# Tensorflow 
I have created a notebook which contains all the required basics to get started with Tensorflow.                                  
Topics covered are:   
-> Creating and Running a Session                                                       
-> Basic Maths Operations                                                                 
-> Rounding and Comparision                                           
-> Rank and Shape of a tensor                                           
-> Creating tensors                                                       
-> Transforming tensors                                                                       
-> Exponents and Logarithms Operations                                                      
-> Vectos and Matrix Operations                                                                 
-> Executing Graphs in Session                                                                                       
-> Forming Graphs                                                                                       
-> Interactive Session in Tensorflow                                                                                      
-> Variables and Placeholders
