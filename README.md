# Tensorflow 
I have created a file which contains all the required basics to get started with Tensorflow.                                 
Topics covered are:               
-> Basic Maths Operations                                                                 
-> Rounding and Comparision                                           
-> Rank and Shape of a tensor                                           
-> Creating tensors                                                       
-> Transforming tensors                                                                       
-> Exponents and Logarithms Operations                                                      
-> Vectos and Matrix Operations
